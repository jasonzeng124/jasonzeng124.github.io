Ok, did a bit of nontrivial stuff between the last blog and now.

School is fine, mostly worried about apush, ap lit, and ap chem. My ap lit teacher likes poetry and half of the stuff he says goes straight over my head.....

Did ucup yesterday, we did ok as a team, I didn't really solve anything (solved C but n685 solved independently, solved A except for a big edge case). The official solve to the even/odd MST problem is nice, uses some cool matroid properties (literally my first thought at looking at the problem) and cool convexity stuff. Sadly I didn't make any progress, despite learning about matroid stuffs last week....

There is a div3 that just ended (as of writing). Most of my friends ak'd. F is a easy math problem, G is a cool NT problem, and the only solve I know for H is $O(n \log n \sqrt n)$ nooooooo.


ok reading patrick's code (since when did n685 start using rust noooo its not readable), I realized that you don't need log^2 for big blocks, if you just use prefix sums (im dumb im dumb im dumb im so dumb).


ok I'll start a CNOI virtual now, see how it goes :D
