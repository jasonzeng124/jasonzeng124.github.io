Oops looks like I didn't blog for a week... Didn't really feel like it, plus nothing really to write about tbh (tl;dr is got sick for a few days and didn't rly do anything lmaoo)

ucup was on saturday, actually got to do it this time. Did pretty well (best rank so far), personally I solved the Random Numbers problem (well ok. n685 actually solved it). And then bricked on the fibonacci problem (got the 2 crucial observations). Then I decided to use bigint instead of :hmm: taking it all mod some large number like everyone else would (haha). brain not working ig

Today was arc, started 40 minutes late, got A, then trolled on B (i solved it completely except i missed a goto at the end lmao). To everyone asking why I use gotos, im just better.

Then did cf, started the round by trolling A for 10 minutes, then taking B, then trolling C for 20 minutes (literally just tried random stuff and submitted). Then Haccerkat pings me on discord to do A lmao, i go back to read A, then realize I misread and solve A. Then I instantly mindsolve D1D2 but it takes me like 1.5 hours to fix 2 bugs (and I would have completely missed D2 if I was 5 minutes later).........


ok I hope I will do better than this next time lol
