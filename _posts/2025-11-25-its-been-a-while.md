title, really. I plan on reviving this blog actually.

Looking back at my past blogs, it's kinda nice to know, like, kinda what i did... and looking back, I do regret not blogging at all.

I've been planning on writing a few blogs on more philosophical stuff too.

anyway, roughly, what did I do last year????? it feels......

well, I'm going to miss a lot of stuff here. sorry (to myself)... some stuff will also be a bit vague, sorry.

some highlights of the past year:
 - trolled usaco
 - got rejected from like 6 or 7 summer camps (all of them; i stopped counting after a while)
 - played a lot of tractor
 - wasn't very productive
 - the usual
 - quit arknights
 - played nethack for a while
 - im addicted to tetr now

To be honest, I have this sort of tingling regret about junior year... that there's something I wanted to still do, but I couldn't. In retrospect, I really couldn't have hoped for more, and yet... I really wanted to make camp...

and that's like until the start of this year? (ish). stay tuned ig?

lmk in comments if there is anything you want me to blog about, i guess.
