So, did sat and fbhc today. Kinda tiring ngl.

SAT was fine, not gonna say much but kinda trolled reading mod 2 and math was kinda trivial (desmos be catching all my sillies). Predicting... 1570+-30? :pray:

FBHC was nice, I trolled by penalty time tho...

A brief edi and thoughts:

A: Nice & cute problem, misread at first :skull:

B: Didn't notice observation at first so tried to cheese with fft :skull: then realized it wasn't going to work (max test takes 26s). fft constant terrible. then realized that primes are mostly odd except 2 so you just count twin primes.........

C: Math problem. Notice that E[lose x pounds] = x E[lose 1 lb] by linearity of expectation, then ~~try to bash with catalan numbers and math nonsense~~ notice E[drop 1 at z from limit] = 2 + e[drop 1 at z-1 from limit] and E[drop 1 at 0 from limit]=1.

ABC took me 2 hours :sob: it should have taken like 20 minutes...

Then solved D and ran out of time ... cancer casework problem:

Notice 0,3-9 will define boundaries of numbers. Split the string by 0, 3-9. It's always optimal-ish to use 2s and 1s for ?s. You have to do casework on the last 2 chars of each segment (??, 1?, 2?, ?0, ?1~6, ?7~9), so I couldn't implement in time...

> upd 2024/10/5: got trolled, there are even more cases or something :skull:

clearly I'm washed... have to get better ig.
