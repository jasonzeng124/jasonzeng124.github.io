> sprinting toward the tipping point, and I'll meet you when I get there --(redacted)

Not much grinding happened, sadly. idk. gonna lock in after sat hopefully.

School is fine, doing ok, starting to regain some sanity...

Around last week, I realized that the SAT was this saturday. So I kinda had to drop everything and grind SAT. I'm mocking mid 1500s, hoping for good luck and no sillies on this saturday.

road map after sat:
* first, FBHC Round 1
* by next week I want to finish purcell ch5 and move on to purcell ch6 ("indefinitely postponed" smh)
* probably going to take a break and review mech, using k&k? if you have a better suggestion lmk
* cp wise: i don't even know... I feel like i shouldn't virtual before upsolving... probably going to virtual ioi either next weekend or the one after... hoping for >AI score :D
* speaking of ai, usaco is probably doomed for me D: oh well, at least i tried
* summer camp apps are kinda starting... gotta do primes pset and apply for rsi (idk if i have a chance, but might as well try..)

oh, and psat is next friday. Well, it's kinda joever anyway cuz NJ cutoff is not possible.

Well, in reflection... I don't actually think I'm going anywhere (usaco camp is too hard, don't have enough time to study for usapho camp). kinda sad ngl.

:blobreach: to anyone who is reading, and bye! :wave:
