lol

very sadge


A I got 50 with trivial n^2, then guessed that there werent that many for 85...
thought about gcd structure but didnt get anywhere

B I got the easy dp subtask, then tried to ds bash but overcomplicated it (pst + persistent dsu is crazy)

C I got like 15 points (didnt figure out how to do type 2 stuffs). didnt have time to implement anything

anyway this contest felt very bad :skull: idk better luck next time ig... need to upsolve 4 cnoi problems + virtual ioi

oh btw ioi was over a few days ago... congrats rain, rohin, agastya, brian! sto bnxe orz also zhoukangyang orzorzorzorz
