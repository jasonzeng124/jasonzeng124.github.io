Short meeting today.

Electrical issue was fixed, IDK how. Probably some loose connection. Drivetrain is more-or-less tuned to my satisfaction. LYT does some driver practice and complains about controls. Will fix in class tomorrow.

I forgot to push so I gotta go resolv the merge conflicts later ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

i hate merge conflicts. and idk if pull --rebase will make it easier idk.

this reminds me of the one developer working on code, still has merge conflicts meme. because literally i am having merge conflicts with myself :skull:

-----

what else is there to say?

i've decided that i'll say something when i see literally anything but a drivetrain.

for now, and perhaps for a while, the only thing that i will say is this: from what it looks like, i'm right. and it doesn't look like i will be wrong anytime soon.

indeed insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results :pensive:

-----

Well programming is on a slight backlog (well everything is backlogged when your schedule is 0 days) so, here's what i'll do tomorrow:

- in dig class: figure out lyt controls: 1) right JS for heading 2) some crabish drive where right JS < deadband implies face drive direction and maybe 3) snap controls
- after school: get the shooter working. take shots. get apriltag localization working. take data.
- bonus: figure out the ball localization framework for auto data collection

And here's what the rest of the team will do:
- nothing. literally nothing.

ok, to be fair what they do isn't entirely visible to me. but it is quite clear to me that its too slow no matter what they are doing.
