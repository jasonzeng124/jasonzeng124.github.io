The captains wanted to add sundays. maybe they will next week, but one of our mentors told us not this sunday b/c of the superbowl.

isn't this a bit absurd?...

-----

Mechies think they're better than design. that they'll get everything done in a week. well, where is the intake?

I also think I'll get everything done in a week. :pensive: perhaps it's best if I change that. At least I'm not telling everyone that i can get everything done in a week tho, unlike the mechies.

Maybe if I stop coding swerve myself it will be done in a week. but thats no fun. If it comes to that i'll do it tho.

It's funny how every monday I have a good idea of where everything's going. And as the week goes on I just like give up on trying to change it, because nobody wants to change anything.

And upon weekends with some time to think I realize how much harm has been done in waiting.

Why am I still waiting? this is insanity. something has to change. nothing has changed yet.

The best way to agree on a decision is to not involve everyone who will disagree.

Well I guess I will have to make the decisions all by myself...

Hopefully only after it is all done will they realize that a decision has even been made.

Anyway it seems like over the past month (month!) my life has been like basically only robotics. Something like go to school, school (and skip a class or two for robotics), then robotics until 8, then go home and do some hw and ~~write blog~~. ~~and then get not enough sleep~~.

On weekends I've either been busy with like usaco or shovelling snow or something. That is when I'm not at robotics for another 6 hours.

And the very few days that I'm free (e.g. today) I burn on... i don't know??? they just pass like they were never there. (what did i do today??? ???)

I'm suffering from a ton of burnout right now. And a bit of sleep deprivation probably. I lowk need a break but I don't think i'll get one.
