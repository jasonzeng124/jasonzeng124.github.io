Meeting was from 12 to 3 today.

I don't even know why they decided to meet today. But it doesn't really matter.

After some thinking and some talking (i.e. with smx and mk) and some reading blog posts. I've realized that continuing along this path is insanity. This year we are like doing almost exactly as we were doing in 2023.

Insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results.

-----

If you've read like a positive number of previous posts you would know exactly why I think the current plan is doomed. So I'm not even going to mention it.

Anyway I arrive at 12:30. Only KC and mentor D are present.

I tell them I want to move to backup plan. Some talking. KCC is not opposed. KC wants to wait until Tuesday. Hmm sounds very familiar...

My stated reasons are roughly mostly scheduling-based. The main reason is that backup plan + 1 week trumps the current plan anyway. Even assuming the current plan goes as planned.

Anyway MI comes in. Surely this is enough for a quorum (AP and CET really don't count, surely). Anyway I tell MI about this. He's not opposed either.

But no real decision.

I decided to make the decision for them. Quote: "Ok, so we are going to make a decision. In reality, I'm going to make the decision, and you guys will have the illusion that we made the decision". Well that is decided.

We tell AG over the phone. He doesn't really say anything, but he will have plenty to say tomorrow, I'm sure about that.

CET comes in. We tell him. The familiar objections. At the end he accepts. Not that he had any choice but to do so.

CET: "I thought the backup plan was kitbot"

me: "No, it's not kitbot. Although if it were kitbot, that's still what we'd be doing"

After all anything is better than insanity.

So after the decision we talk a bit about team productivity:

- consensus that most of team is not quite productive
- mechies need something to do
- too much kids playing bloons td 6 or brawl or something

Solutions:
- kick unproductive freshmen out after like 4
- phone holders
- we gotta start machining anyway

-----

After that we do some shooter testing, with the shooter that we just finished (welll.... it's not going to be used...). Nothing of note. The testing infra was too rough for any useful observations.

CET works on drivetrain wiring. Although ngl that's like last priority. It really doesn't matter right now at all.

I do some drivetrain coding. We should have finished drivetrain code by Wednesday EOD, fully tuned and tested.

-----

Oh and I'm tech captain (officially) now. yay ig.

So under the new plan, CAD should be done by end of week. Robot by end of next week. Then two weeks for programming + driver practice.

Sounds good, or, at least better than insanity...
