If I don't get more sleep I'll be burnt out by next tuesday. I'm basically pulling overtime every period where I can and until like 9PM and on weekends.

I'm not going to write any more blogs, or at least until after comp. Or if I do write something it will be short.

Today not much happened. Mechanical fixes. Electrical fixes.

Drivetrain got working. More (vibe) coding. Funny thing: me+claude code outperforms like every past set of programming team members.

Well from now on it'll really be the same thing. Not too much variation, huh.

It is my turn to do things, I guess. I only get a week, sad. Everyone else gets so much time. Well if everything works out it is all due to me...
