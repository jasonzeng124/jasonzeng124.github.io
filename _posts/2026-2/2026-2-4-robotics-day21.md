So like robotics.

I look in shop and nobody is there.


Remember this?

Well it is indeed 2/4. Shooter is not shooting in any way that is reliable enough for me to actually test anything useful.

Intake is not on the robot yet.

CAD is not quite done. They are getting closer every day. But not done.

It's funny how I can be proven right and still nobody will believe me. Whatever, it doesn't even matter anymore.

Anyway wrt drivetrain, I've basically coded and tuned most of it. There is an electrical issue. It's not going to be fixed if I don't fix it :wilted_rose:

I don't want to fix it :wilted_rose:

Also why is programming on a backlog now......

<br />

They are, what? prototyping elevator or shooter or something? can they give me something that i can test????? especially if I don't run after them every single second for it???

Nothing is being manufactured that I can see....

Cad is going, but slowly. At least I think my 2/6~2/10 prediction will be right.

Oh and key parts are still being changed. I convinced AG to go with belt drive, for once. And we realized that our shooter angle is terrible.

<br />

Nothing I can do but trust the process, I guess. And I will have to lock in and just program for the next month or so.

If they are going to fail I should let them fail, I guess. Not that I can stop it.

At least I can make sure I don't fail.
