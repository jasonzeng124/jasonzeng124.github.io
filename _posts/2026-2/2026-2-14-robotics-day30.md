Robotics is going full overtime at this point, they met from like 11:30 and were there until at least 7:00. This is going to happen tomorrow too. And monday.

Well tbh I need some sanity so I went like 1:50 to 6:30.

I get there, meet LXM. He thinks we're cooked too. "very cooked"

Find Mentor S. Plan prototype robot for a bit. Find 2 neo vortexes. one is labeled "bad". I test it it looks not bad to me. not bad anymore IG.

Anyway plan out prototype robot. I tell him to get it built.

Also me: "steal whatever axles you need. if they need it it's their fault for not labeling it"

It will be done Monday. certainly.

Back to coding. To test out the software for localizing the balls I first need to make sure it can localize a coordsys correctly with undistortion etc.

So localizing a coordsys. I need a grid.

The bathroom has nice 10.85cm square tiles!

Anyway we vibecode another version and then go into the bathroom and setup the computer camera apriltags etc. And do some testing.

Apparently the wifi in the bathroom sucks really bad so we have to come out of bathroom to do the prompting :skull:

Anyway after like 30 minutes and realizing that I can't use a ruler, it works. yay.

The apriltags are still in the bathroom btw.

Anyway there is still stuff to do:

vibecode ~~prompt list~~ todo list:
- test bigger angles
- test balls
- test motion
- test if i can shift coordsys by a bit of z
- integrate with robot shooting
- automate everything

Come back. Apparently the acrylic cracked so we're using 1/32" aluminum for the backing now. that stuff is fun to play with LMAO. also american units SUCK

anyway we find motors and motor mounts, etc etc etc. figure out intake etc.

we are at the point where it's basically gonna be done by sunday I think. I hope.

I have no idea what the main robot is waiting for... It's waiting for something but nobody seems to have the urgency of "oh no we gotta do this fast". It is waiting for something. And said something doesn't look like it will come anytime soon tbh.

I do some messing around with them but at this point I do really believe that we are going with the backup robot shooter mounted on the main robot. They don't seem to believe me.

It looks like they still want to win in style (i.e. not with a wood robot). But they won't have a choice. I hope.

3.5 work days left until Wednesday.
