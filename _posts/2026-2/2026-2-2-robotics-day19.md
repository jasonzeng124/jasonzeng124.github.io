As expected the meeting was quite heated as soon as it started.

Let me state some prior proability (for those who don't know, this means my belief at 2:15 today), first of all. Prior expected finish date given current design was 2/20. Given backup design is 2/13.

Initially only AG is against the backup plan. His argument is very simple: he believes that he can get it done.

*how*?

I don't have a screenshot of the board. But his schedule had something like
- finish elevator and shooter cad today
- cad done on friday
- robot on next wednesday

who believes him?

?????

-----

Apparently everyone else does. AG is making his famous claim of "CAD done tomorrow" and people are biting for the $n$-th time ($n \gg 1$). And they are justifying it by "we have the plasma cutter so machining will take like no time at all"

I feel like ive seen this entire thing at some point, it just feels so unrealisitcally familiar. And the plasma cutter is just an excuse to push back the design deadline???

And anyway, people believe him?

I try to force it by setting CAD deadline today, or go to backup plan. Unfortunately nobody listens to me. We had an agreement yesterday????? What's worse, mentor D rugpulls my tech captain position, so I really can't do anything?

Well the mentors don't believe him. None of them do.

Some golden quotes, from assorted mentors (don't worry mentors I kept you anonymous, but you all seem to agree anyway):

> "do you believe this?" "no way"

> "you're cooked"

> "do you think the robot can be done next week?" "*Absolutely!*" (with obvious sarcasm intended)

> "... \*whispers to me\* just let them fail"

-----

Even KC's schedule has robot done on like 2/4 or something. And CAD done like a week ago.

I have been procrastinating telling them to switch to backup plan for a while.

It should have been done a good while ago. LYT was right. All the signs were there, and quite obvious from the onset of week 2.

I really didn't have the heart to do it, to be honest. And had I tried, nobody would have believed me. It would have been too early. Does anyone even believe me now?

But it would have been better to try earlier. Not that it would have worked. It definitely would not have worked.

-----

There seems to be some sort of opposition to copying WCP competitive concept. Well my design in mind was simpler.

What is this opposition? some sort of... pride? culture? just.... what? "we're too good for this"???

And a general mood of sunk-cost fallacy...

-----

Anyway today I look into the shop, it's empty.

Just like the many days to come.

-----

Mentor D and KC say that they'll give AG until Tuesday. I don't believe them. Come Tuesday, they will give AG until Wednesday.

I've decided that this is all insanity and that if I want something done I should Do It Myself TM. So I'm going to neglect all my programming responsiblities, and race AG to CAD a working robot. I think I can be realistically done by EOD Tuesday.

I predict on the backup plan we can get things done a week before the original plan. And backup plan + 1 week definitely beats original plan.

-----

And what happened today?

Some cutting axles to length. Some playing with plasma cutter.

A bit of programming. But not much.

I think there were like 2 plates added to CAD.

...

My estimated timelines have not changed. At all. Maybe I should move them back a day because literally nothing happened today.

-----

So I wanted to give a rough history of what has happened the past like 5 or so days, in cad. This is based on past blog posts, but is more or less as accurate as it gets...

It might be useful to read this section from bottom up.

Today, our total CAD progress: Intake + Drivetrain finished. Hopper finished, extension is still WIP. Shooter roughly finished, not mounted, turret not finished. Elevator "CADed" but doesn't really look very finished to me. Spindexer is just a circle with no mounting whatsoever.

Day 19. Added like 2 plates to CAD for spindexer mounts

Day 18. Sunday meeting. Nothing.

Day 17. Discussion on limit switches. Nothing?

Day 16. Nothing?

Day 15. Started mounting hopper and hopper extension. Shooter is cut.

Day 14. Trimmed drivetrain dimensions. There is a spindexer "CAD" (basically a circle on CAD). We decide on spindexer

Day 13. IDK, was there for 5 minutes. At this point anything to be prototyped has been prototyped.
> Atharv promised me the cad would be done by EOD. But also whenever I turned to look at it he would spin it really fast “you can’t see anything” Anyway I give him deadline of CAD done EOD shooter done tuesday.

Day 12. Intake CAD (w/o mounting IIRC) finished
> I had half a mind to declare a bail already but I’ll give AG one last chance

Day 11. Nothing.
At this point we have a rough shooter CAD, and a rough intake + drivetrain CAD.
