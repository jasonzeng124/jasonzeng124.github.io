lowk feeling a lot of stress right now. More than I've felt, in a long time. or ever?

-----

anyway i did the shooter testing, it all works, IDK how accurate the data will be tho, it's hard to collect with bathtub cuz it keeps losing connections.

I'll have to see on the real robot I guess? Or I'll just do something awfully simple on the real robot, more likely that'll happen.

Robot theoretically is done, we got CAN IDs working and intake running* (just the motors.) Anyway intake joint is 5:1 and hits stall torque (it used to be 1:1 :skull:). Anyway we are slapping planetary and it should work.

Net is being thrown on the robot

I think I can drive it tomorrow after stealing some bathtub electronics? I guess the vision of the bathtub robot actually running isn't going to happen because simply not enough people care enough to do it, and I can't / don't want to do it myself. RIP bathtub I guess, ~~it served its purpose (really it didnt do anything)~~ it was fun while it lasted.

More or less like not much else has to go on robot I think... climber? but I'm allowing max like 15 mins for that to happen (or not to happen). IG robot is mine now after some intake fixes and electrical fixes.

finally........? it's been too long. way too long.

well I have a feeling this won't be the last issue we encounter........ well I hope ... ... ... 

i just hope that at the end of the day it works....

i've pulled too much overtime for this not to work :sob:
