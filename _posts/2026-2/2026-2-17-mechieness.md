Doing robotics has made me realize something: it would be so nice to be a mechie. Just a normal mechie.

All you would have to do is ask for some random part to be assigned, make it, and give it back. There's really nothing to worry about. If something is wrong, it becomes a design problem or a programming problem.

You don't have to worry about timelines, or schedules, or how much time you'll have to make a part. You won't have to worry about not having enough time to write autos. Or the design not working. Or whether you win comp or not (after all, you only really had positive contribution; you can't possibly have net negative contribution). All you have to do is move forward and machine your part.

Wouldn't that be so nice? just so nice? to just do, and not think?

Indeed, my friend RG was right in choosing to become a mechie.

This reminds me of something one of my SG friends said about military service:

It would be really great if life were just so simple...
