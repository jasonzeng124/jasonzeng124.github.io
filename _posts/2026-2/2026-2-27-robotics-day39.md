robot works. ish. pulled overtime until 9 today, will be overtime until comp basically.

i wasn't going to write more blogs but there are things i would have to write down anyway. the following will be a utterly scrambled chain of thought

- robot done today
- shooting is not too consistent for a single shooter but its ok
- ball capacity like 10 max, clogs everywhere, i no like. LYT and AG no like either
- will work on tuning later. tuning done sunday. functionality and shot tuning monday

- our conditoins on win is 1) passing works well and we do it well and 2) we get lucky enough and other teams aren't as good and 3) climber.
- estimated probability 5%
- on big box we should set a condition for switching by sun. LYT suggests, top 12 or switch to box.
- estimated probability given switch now lik 30%
- given switch sunday of comp, 10%
- big box will be done. it must be done.

- LYT and AG working on new robot design. i dont believe.
- if it is to be done it has to be really simple and done really fast

- LYT was right all along. I should've listened to him more. ajsdklfgakdjksjkfjskdjflksdj

wow when i try to write stuff it becomes much harder to remember what i discussed. oh well that is enough

well its basically me now. i gotta try my best ig.
