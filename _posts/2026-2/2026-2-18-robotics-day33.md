Nothing is going right right now.

-----

So like what I did:

I made sure there were people working on backup robot (i'll call it BATHTUB from now on, thanks RS). That is, that it'd get wired.

TL; DR. It did not get wired.

Then worked on the ball vision detection. The problem with that is that the ball has shadows, so it's only really possible to detect the top half of the ball in the shop. And the gyms have a very pretty yellow stripe the exact same color as the balls. 

We'll probably borrow another room later.

prompt queue:

> use larger apriltags
> use custom family?
> tune apriltag detector params, use pupil-apriltag

more prompts:
> make shooter / indexer
> refactor intake branch
> do choreo autos
> code full backup robot
> make stupid asf autos

Anyway we kinda give up with that for now, it looks like it'll work. BTW i finally ran out of credits and got KC to buy me claude code. and then one of our designers told me he had claude code MAX x5 and could give it for free. Well you should've said that 5 minutes ago... but it's like $20 so who really cares.

So then I let HP work on shooter code (I might rewrite a good bit myself). And I tried to convince Mentor S about big box (well at least the info i told him about bumpers is useful... I think I can convince him to build a big box as backup...).

Anyway sooner or later Mr. H comes in. He sees robot.

> "i don't expect this to be done today, and i expect that when I walk in tomorrow, it'll be half disassembled"

he's right, to be honest.

Anyway he asks me about autos but we can't really test it and the backup robot isn't finished (it ends up being a single freshman working on it LMAO thanks IP). And there are other issues with the backup robot like the bellypan being inverted but literally touching the ground.

anyway he realizes there's nothing to do and leaves (this is like 10 minutes total btw). well I told Mentor D to tell him not to come in but he forgor or something :skull:. Before he left he told us intake was likely to shatter and we should make a metal backup. It looks like we are going to reinforce with metal.

Oh and he does not expect robot to be done in time.

After dinner I continue to try to wire it but I'm informed that there are literally no crimps left.....

what is electrical team doing.......

anyway mentor L won't let me e-tape wires together after twisting them (it'll work trust me bro). quote: "if this robot doesn't drive by friday it's ok"

well after that i just started ignoring her. not worth paying attn tbh. stuff has to be done even if it's not done the right way.

well I guess I'm cutting p4 tomorrow to solder the rest of this thing. I don't care what Mentor L says now. It will be working and I don't care if I do it the wrong way.

Somehow CET and Mentor D are still very optimistic. smth smth "we will get it together if we work together" smh smh smh. "you should be supportive and help us out" well the code is already done so IDK what you want me to do.

I know what I'm going to do.

Actually today I checked out our competition in week 1 with the other captains. It appears that everyone else (60%?) will have a working shooter. And if we shoot, we don't stand a chance if we can't do better than them.

Do we think we're better than them? of course not.

"i'm supporting the real robot now because I have a better backup plan" - me. said better backup plan is to build a big box in an hour.
