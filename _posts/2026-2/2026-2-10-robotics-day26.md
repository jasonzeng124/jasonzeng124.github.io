Did a lot of carrying electronics in my pocket and trying to get it to work in class. tl;dr did not work in class (or ever) cuz the orangepi from 2024 got fried somehow. rip.

carrying electronics around is stupid anyway never going to do that again. it was kinda funny tho.

Anyway second pi is up and running. gonna attach to 2025 robot and get full loc working, path planning working, and maybe basic stupid autos if i get time.

oh and i need to get fans for the pi. since if i tell electrical to do something it wont get done. remind me to do this.

other than that didn't do much ngl.

well I was only in the shop for like 2 hours ish total so that explains it.

i wanted to say something else here but i forgot what.

i probably won't be here tomorrow. Or if i will I will be until 4. I need some rest before f=ma ngl.

i was going to write more here. something more thoughtful. but i think it deserves a separate blog post. I'll write until 10 today (then sleep) and if i finish i'll publish early i guess.
