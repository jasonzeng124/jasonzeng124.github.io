Funny things that happened:

- turret is cooked. somehow. guess who told AG to use the lazy susan???
- CET tried to cut thru a 3d print with a soldering iron. well the print was ASA, which releases a neurotoxin when heated...... (don't people have sense nowadays? don't burn plastic???)
- bellypan was still not there as of 6:00 PM.

Oh and one more thing
- sometime in the middle of the meeting all the captains met up in the shop and started competing to see who weighs the most. yes. If I didn't yell at them they would have been there for longer.

Well backup robot is done minus wiring and coding (well code is done probably or like very close). But nobody's doing that :pensive: I'll make sure it gets done sometime LOL. Somehow nobody believes me at all LOL. It's comical at this point.

Mentor S believes that we'll go with our original robot, then maybe fail or something and then revert to something like the backup robot if we see that everyone successfull is doing something like that..... That our best shot at the first comp is failing or doing mediocre seems like admitting defeat really.

I realistically believe: robot done and functional > Friday, probably next Wednesday. Code done the week after. Autos will take another week. Then ~~two weeks of driver practice~~ we are already half a week over the comp.

mark my words they're probably going to be right. they're usually not that far off

Theoretically all the code is already basically done. Or really fast to code anyway. I think I can get all the code done before the relevant parts of the robot function. So ideally programming takes 0 days. I did promise AG that all the robot code will be done by tomorrow. It will be done.

But who believes that??? Certainly not me. Stuff will happen and programming will take much longer. It usually does.

A few minutes they sent me a video of the shooter and elevator working. well great i guess, but they didn't really demonstrate anything additional? except that their elevator works IG, I was concerned about that not working. But like I was promised robot today. Robot is nowhere near done today.

The shooter is getting fully tuned tomorrow. Before 5PM. trust me bro.

well we (read: me) do need to move as fast as possible if we want anything to be done...

You know, after some thinking it's funny how I accuse our team of falling for sunk cost fallacy when I am basically doing the same thing.

After all, if we can't make lehigh, why am I even still here? Maybe I should just quit right now and here...

remind me of a few things I want done before comp (actually remind me to read through all the blogs before comp):

- wazer a 2nd intake
- have an easy way of replacing robot with a big box
- finish the backup robot it'll be useful even if we don't use it
