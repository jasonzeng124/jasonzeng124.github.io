Meeting today was like 10:30 to 6. I got there around 12:30?

Working on weekends lowk feels like overtime for me. After like 30 hours of robotics in schoool i'm just too tired and can't really do anything anymore.

In retrospect I didn't really do anything at robotics. Maybe I should've stayed home. Not that I'd do anything productive at home.

Anyway some shooter testing was done. Not very useful. How the shots came in were very important as mentor P forecasted.

Some driver practice. TBH the new drivetrain with all the fancy controls does worse than last year's drivetrain. Or at least it sounds worse, and driving is less smooth I think. Somehow adding better controls made it worse, i'll have to take a look later.

Tested orangepi current and voltage regulation. the buck converter we used in 2025 is garbage, it will shut down voltage below like 7.5V (or higher? maybe? anyway it's basically useless). We bought a new better regulator (or two), it should work. The Opi draws like 0.2 amps so really we don't need to worry too much about exceeding max current.

so back to shooter. Some pondering about how to get rid of a gear and axle that are conveniently annoying me. thinking about figure-8 belts (did not actually do this). And then figuring out elevator & shooter guides.

Also my laptop and prog laptop got disconnected from school wifi which was a pain.

anyway i did not write any code today.

for larger progress i can basically say that cad is basically done (except for some fixes mentioned above). stuff is being builtTM. nothing on robot yet.

Still forecast robot functional to give to programming on 2/20. reason: anticipating issues, probably with elevator or shooter.

i need to figure out the drivetrain code. to be honest maybe doing things the dumb way will be better :facepalm: and i need to work on auto-shooter tuning.

ok im so tired gn
