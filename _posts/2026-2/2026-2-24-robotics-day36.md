Not much to say today?

I mean stuff is being assembled. As it always is.

-----

One thing that annoyed me was that a bunch of stuff was taken from programming and also bathtub and idfk where it went. Took me a while to get bathtub operational again.

what don't people understand by "don't touch the driver station" and "don't touch the bathtub?"

They wired stuff at home, and did some stuff. IG drivetrain works now but haven't really tested it yet, I'll do it tomorrow (ugh i have to deal with CAN i hate life). intake should also work?

-----

The programming vision thingy is such a pain, I couldn't get it to work in time. also too much yellow everywhere. I'll try again somewhere else. Anyway i was gonna vibecode some stuff right now but I ran out of credits (wow i maxed out on 2 5h sessions today).

maybe I'll steal K's claude code max subscription LMAO.

-----

Mentor H came briefly and told me to get the intake working and shaking. Although TBH I think we already know all the issues with the intake. It's always the same issues (bearings + pulleys + axles falling out + polycarb cracking). It's just that nobody wants to fix it and everyone wants to hammer stuff back in.

Well the code is written so it will be running tomorrow during class hopefully.

-----

btw vibe cad is NOT the way to go i'm trying to cad some new glasses frames and claude opus 4.6 burned thru 5 hours of credits in one prompt and the result wasn't even good rip.

LXM predicts robot done next wednesday, I seem to believe that more than what they say (tomorrow???).
