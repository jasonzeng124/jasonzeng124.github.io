Why is it that people don't listen to you when you're right?

I predicted that they wouldn't be done this week. They all said they'd be done by saturday.

At this point, I don't think that's happening.

-----

I know exactly what's going to happen in the next 3 weeks. I don't like it. At all.

But there's nothing I can do to stop it.

-----

Anyway I walk into our shop at like 4:40 and both 2025 and 2026 robots are almost fully disassembled.

The 2025 robot because I told them to disassemble it to make a protobot. But there aren't enough people to reassemble it. Perhaps it just gets abandoned at this point? Maybe Mentor S was right that we shouldn't disassemble it...

The 2026 robot because they, idk, something. Probably couldn't mount something. This isn't the first time. I don't think it'll be the last, either.

Honestly I didn't do anything today. Too tired after f=ma.

Anyway I don't believe that the robot can be done by this week. There's no way.

Whatever, as soon as the intake is done I'll take over try to get a dumb robot working. There is not really a choice after all.

-----

I really hope our climb works. I was originally really against climb, but perhaps the only things on the robot that are going to work are going to be the drivetrain and the climb. :pensive:

I think our team is like

almost beyond hope at this point.

I said this like 12 robotics work-days ago. So like 2 weeks ago.

So far it's been all true.

Well, well, well. I wanted to write a few more true statements here. But why write? it won't change anything anyway.

Why try? it won't change anything.

Is there really a point to continuing? if nothing's going to change? why am i here? why am i still here?

what if i just....
