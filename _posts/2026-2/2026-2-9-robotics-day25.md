Today:

6:30 wake up. go to school.

pick up programming laptop. grind robotics in periods 1 and 2

take orgo test in period 3 and then sleep after i finish test.

drop off programming laptop. go to bio lab. pick up programming laptop (the charger is fixed to the desk and the battery life sucks. anyway i've unfixed the charger from the desk which is great)

grind robotics in 5 and 6

14:15 school ends. go to robotics. until 21:00

The whole day I was wondering how in the world it could possibly still be monday.

Such is life.

Fully retuned the drivetrain, it all works except for a few niche drive modes and fast turning, i'll take a look at those tomorrow.

Finally understand current limits properly now too.

Path following has to be done. I'll have to figure it out. I have to code some stupidly simple manual autos too in case stuff just doesn't work.

Apriltags [the way mr. h wants it] works [although i don't trust mr. h's approach]. Although I should do full localization soon. At some point I should also mass update firmware etc.

I need to work on automated shooter testing as well.

Sounds like enough to occupy me until around Friday. By which time there will be much more to do anyway.

It's kinda sad that we can't have two programmers working on this, because this is like 3x embarassingly parallelizable. But Nothing Really Happens unless I Do It Myself.

KC AG say that literally everything is manufactured and that soon everything will be done and on the robot. Where soon means "Saturday at max" well honestly... if that is true i should believe it, and i think i do believe it. Although of course "saturday at max" for me means "next saturday at max"

oh right I forgot to make sure AG did the shooter shaping right. did you? :eyes: :rapid:

Theoretically CAD is done. Or like eps away from done.

During dinner Mentors S, D, and I were complaining about the new room. Indeed there is a lack of space for everything which makes stuff really disorganized, and it's a pain to find stuff etc. 

At the end of meeting we were just driving for fun. Well might as well I guess. AG is a good driver, he'll probably end up driving.
