Didn't do a lot of programming today. Lowk I need a break.

What I need to do is get vision and path following working and some simple autos. And also get shooter testing working. Well I guess I can do those later.

Anyway as soon as I got into the shop we find out someone put loctite on the polycarb. rip intake plates.

Did some talking with mentor S, about making an illegal backup robot on the old robot. Somewhat inspired by Mech. Adv. 's build blog on chiefdelphi (good read btw).

Anyway after a bunch of talking i decide that talk is cheap and i get KC to actually do it. It'll take like 2 or 3 days but it'll be done, surely.

I go look at design for a bit and apparently RM is designing an end stop with a neo 550 for the hopper. why??? Anyway I tell him (hoepfully he absorbed this) that if we need smth we'll just rack-and-pinion the hopper, and this is stupid. although it looks like using an elastic band on intake to extend hopper should work.

And then I notice that the intake, fully packaged, hits against the back bar of the hopper. facepalm. anyway it takes like half an hour or so to resolve it.

AG shows me the shooter hood print, he did it backward :facepalm:. Anyway i tell AG again how i think it should be done, and he's theoretically doing it...

At that point it's like 4:30 and I go home. need some sleep for f=ma lol (good luck to yall).
