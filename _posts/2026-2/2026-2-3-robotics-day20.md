Things will happen I guess.

Nothing is really in my hands anyway.

I've basically given up trying to make them go with the backup plan. Not that they'd do it, or that it'd be strictly beneficial on this timeline.

If we end up having to do it, I will make it out of wood with Mentor S in a few hours.

It looks like design team is locking in for once. If only the did so, the past month.

KC is satisfied. That's good enough for me. I don't have the energy to care anymore.

I'll just let things go as they go. Not that I have a choice.

I fixed the radio yesterday. I come in today and the programmers tell me it doesn't work. Well I spend like an hour or two fixing that.

Anyway the programmers don't seem to get anything done fast enough. I'll have to accept for this season, that I do everything. Although that truth has been accepted already.

But then I can't micromanage design anymore. I hope I won't need to.

And what will the team do when I'm not there? Oh well, that is their problem. Hopefully it works to the point of "nothing needs to be changed".

Mr. Hadzic comes in and flames me for not having done anything. Which is entirely fair (although TBH a camera distance estimation is quite literally a 20 minute job). Anyway I do the 20 minute job in like 120 minutes (cuz electrical is too slow, and too disorganized; I can't even find a power-to-usb-c adapter, I swear we had like 10 of them). Plus I have to work off laptop cuz electrical isn't ready.

Meanwhile he looks at electrical and realizes that VRM isn't enough for the orangepi power :facepalm: that checks out I guess. Also apparently NOBODY on electrical team knows how many amps run through a 5 volt 5 watt circuit. :facepalm: Even CET. I was literallly dying inside at that moment. I'm still dying inside.

I will indeed be dying inside soon, electrical is literally hopeless.

Anyway we went looking for solutions but apparently (as I found out 5 minutes ago as of writing) you can just use your own converter. That simplifies things.

-----

Design looks like it will be finished tomorrow. That's what they say I guess. Well whatever.

This year there really is no room for error though.

Oh and the shop was still empty for a good part of today.

Oh and it looks like I've been in robotics for around 120 hours this year. wtf...
