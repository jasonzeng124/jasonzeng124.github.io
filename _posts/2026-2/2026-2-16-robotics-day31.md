Went in around 2-4 today.

I think I made it very clear that I will not be putting any effort toward the original robot. They don't seem to understand what that means.

I don't care if they understand or not. Mentor S and I will solo against the entire team and win if we need to.

The team will have no choice but to accept it.

Did some working on backup robot. basically the relevant portion is done. I'll finish up the rest in class on Tuesday. It will be shooting by Wednesday 17:00. I guarantee it.

It looks like original robot subsystems are coming along. Also apparently we are overweight which is probably my fault (i keep on telling them not to worry about it). But it can't be that hard to fix either, just drill some holes and it'll be fine.

Oh and they really didn't have to use so thick metal...

I mean reasonably maybe this will be assembled Wednesday EOD or something. Well actually, that's stupid.

It will be fully assembled maybe Friday EOD if they're lucky. And they seem to think that "robot assembled" = "robot works". oh so naive.

Wow 2 hours is pretty short now that you think of it.
