Is this not enough said?

We are well into week 5. And there is no sign of significant progress. Why?

Of course you can be somewhat simple-minded and blame it all on design. or mechanical. or whatever.

But there are deeper underlying issues at play here.

In this blog I want to take a look at some of the more fundamental cultural issues that are causing us to fail. consistently.

-----

I want to take a look at the team, as a single entity first.

What does the team want? Well, for one, to win.

But not just to win.

The team wants to win *in style*.

<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p>

What does *winning in style* mean? For different people, it means different things. But for 41, my feel is that *style* looks like the following:

- The robot looks pretty.
- The design is ""original""
- We build most of it ourselves
- We have full CAD which the team fully follows
- We can score fancy stuff, like high climbs or L4 coral
- etc etc etc.
