> "i don't expect this to be done today, and i expect that when I walk in tomorrow, it'll be half disassembled"

he was right.

-----

so the team really didn't do much today. so I'll talk about what I did, I guess.

So I went in period 2 and 4 and soldered all the wires and made sure everything worked. (wait did it really take that long? idk). And afterward I try to figure out POE (did figure it out, didn't actually do it), and wired the pi/camera.

Then I checked the CAN network and something was wrong.

After like 3 hours of binary search I realized that I missed a joint when I was soldering, and guess what? green goes to yellow and yellow goes to green on the one joint that i missed :sob:.

Anyway we fix it and it is fixed. that is about like dinner.

-----

After dinner I decide to organize some stuff that I don't want to lose. Mostly stuff like usb cables etc.

I came to the perhaps obvious realization that stuff really only gets taken care of when people personally take responsiblity for it. Like IH's screwdriver kit (well it is hers) or OG's nice electrical toolbox (the glagg is now severly understocked).

Also I found a bunch of random nice stuff like the laser pointer (haven't seen since 2023) or a brand new multimeter and etc.

Anyway tomorrow I'll probably go thru the room and see if I want anything else and then actually code stuff.
