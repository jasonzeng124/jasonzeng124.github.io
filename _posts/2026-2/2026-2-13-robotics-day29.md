> We are at the point where if there is no significant progress made, we'll have to bail out for a (very simple) robot. I had half a mind to declare a bail already but I'll give AG one last chance. Well at least everyone knows about bailout plan :D.

I'm so tired today. I really can't do this anymore.

Nothing is meaningfully being assembled. Some excuse about waiting for Mentor M on the climber.

Talked with Mentor S and came up with plan for 2025 robot. It is happening, but slowly. Stupid supervision rules that they can't break.

I want this to be done Sunday. Fully operational Monday. Maybe even put it on the real robot Tuesday.

I feel like somehow I'm busy the whole day but honestly IDK what I did today.

Programming wise I'm having HP and LYT work on vibe coding the ball tracking stuff. But they really don't know what they're doing, and vibe coding isn't helping them at all. I used 25% of my monthly copilot allownace today :skull: Sorry I just checked. it's 50%. wtf.

They don't really understand how to vibe code ts, I'll probably end up having to do it myself...

I've started vibe coding the rest of the robot in class. I've promised AG it'll be done EOD wednesday, and ready to just tune.

In every class I'm just vibe coding at this rate. Stuff will get done trust. Or at least on my side

Mentor H came in. Was quite disappointed by lack of progress.

He thinks the electricals for the pi will work. at least that's good.

Wanted to do some shooter testing. After like 3 shots the bearing came loose. They took like 30m fixing it, he had already left by then.

Before that he made sure to make a point that we're cooked. He wants to see robot next time he comes, tuesday at like 5. If not, we're cooked. Indeed, he told us that we should "drop the first comp and run the second one for consolation" if we don't finish the robot by next wednesday...

i don't think text is adequate to express how cooked we are, and how i feel about this. so i won't.

But everyone else seems to feel like everything is going as normal.

This weekend everyone is pulling overtime full-time. On sat, sun, and mon. And on tues it is quite possible that we might skip school to work on the robot.

I hope that they realize that they have literally 4 days to get this done. if it's not then we're absolutely cooked.

Perhaps our only hope is the backup plan.... but even that is quite sketchy as of right now.
