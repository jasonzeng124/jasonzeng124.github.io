*written about events of yesterday; note: i don't remember a lot...*

was too lazy to try to organize stuff. anyway did some coding and testing. the bathtub works*

*well there was a issue with balls overcompressing and stalling the indexer but I think that's fixed.

It more-or-less worked first deploy minus motor directions and similar stuff. well and some electrical stuff iirc. and a screw needing to be loctited. etc etc.

driver station switches broke. they will stay broken, i'm not fixing it. every time you touch that thing it only gets worse.

the robot is starting to look like a robot. most of it looks like it'll work, minus climber cuz I haven't seen it yet.

And minus extending hopper. I give it a 10% chance of working, to be generous. We decided that making a net was the right course of action, although I don't see anyone who is taking charge of making one. Maybe I'll bring in some random string on Monday and make it myself.

Anyway I am not seeing much of a robot. I honestly think the earliest I'll get it is next Friday. The earliest.

oh remind me to remind them to make extra intake plates.

*now today (2/21)*

anyway today I didn't come in. although LXM came in and gave me a few updates.

tl;dr many thing seem to be cooked. LXM estimates that it'll take another week.

well... anyway i'll have all calibration scripts written before then...

My teacher Mr. G used to coach 41, and he told me I should triple timelines (instead of doubling them). I'm now convinced that he's entirely right.

it's too late to change anything. it'll have to work, I guess...
