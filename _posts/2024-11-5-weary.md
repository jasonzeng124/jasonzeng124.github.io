Right now, I'm procrastinating AP Lit HW (due yesterday) to write this (peak productivity).

In the past month (wait perfectly a month? nice coincidence lol) the only actual productive
thing I did was do the primes problemset... so when olys come up (amc tmrw, usaco @ dec, fma @ feb, etc)
I'm going to be so washed...

School is fine, none of the classes are *that* hard per se but ap lit is a lot of hw and apush is
a lot of trolling tests...

Was gonna lay out a roadmap here, but we all know how that turns out...
so i guess i just do what i need to? idk, hope it turns out well, i guess...

ps hope to keep this blog updated a bit more frequently... also probably
going to migrate to a more minimalist theme cuz this one is really overkill...

pps i really have to stop playing arknights instead of doing hw
