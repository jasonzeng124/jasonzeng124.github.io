Summer is almost running out... Since the last blog post, I haven't done any math/physics/cp. And there's so much I still have to learn. 

Instead of grinding, I've been working on image preprocessing for a ML project. That means I've mostly been working on getting environments and configurations working noooooo. I miss cp :blobpat:

My school starts on the 29th of August, meaning I have roughly 3 weeks. And I had planned to finish all of Purcell at the beginning of the summer (lmao, 3/12 fr). And I still have all of summer HW to do. Looks like I'll just have to get more productive during the school year. But apush exists...

At this point I think it's pretty reasonable to say I won't finish what I planned for this year sadge. ig I don't have a chance for redeeming my 3-year F=ma fail streak...
