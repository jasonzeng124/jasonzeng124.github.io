Didn't really do anything last weekend besides play card games ig. It feels like everyone around me is grinding, and I'm not. I'm actually not grinding at all now...

There are people who have done more cp in a week than I have since camp :dead: And I probably don't have time for any cp because of summer homework.

Also, any suggestions on what to grind in school? I'm thinking of trying to finish CSES (50 problems left :D) and then idk... probably upsolve usaco + camp? idk, if you have suggestions pls share.

At this rate idk if i will camp next year (oi or physics).

At least next weekend I have cerealcodes (gonna get carried by 2 campers) and LIT (gonna get carried by a 2025 holstein)... hope I do well in these.
