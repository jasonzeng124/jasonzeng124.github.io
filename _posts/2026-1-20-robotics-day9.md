Came in at like 4 today (none of the physics club kids took up my offer to stay until 5 lol).

Mentor S was working on a spindexer prototype. By the end of the day it did had some progress, although it did not demonstrate anything that we didn't know... There are many other things to be refined to be considered a good prototype although it is more or less what we expected.

There was a hopper prototype in working too. It also did get some progress, although we need more rollers (they're ordered....). Didn't really prove anything yet.

Neither prototype is really good enough to prove that they work (or work well). But at least they are being made. I'm more inclined toward the simpler rollers-in-hopper style of indexing because it is less thinking, but we'll see I guess...

Intake cad is being roughly finalized (wow oxymoron). We did one prototype which had a dead spot between the two rollers (although it works with momentum). We're making another one which should be done tomorrow.

I don't know how shooter CAD progressed but today I took a look and it looks pretty good. Some things need adjusting but the base shooter minus turret should be able to be replicated for prototyping tomorrow.

Looking at design in general RS is a lost cause. rip. Although tbh leading prototypes is more important, design is not *that* important compared to getting stuff prototyped.

Roughly we are around half a week behind where I want to be at. That's not that bad, but when we get a full week behind I'll have to reconsider things.

Back before build season started I proposed an idea to the captains, plus a few others like KL. The idea: I take a group of capable people and we build the best robot we can in 5 days.

It was unanimously rejected.

But what are we doing now? Sooner or later we'll have prototypes, which once we put together and have them interact (which is quite necessary in this game) they'll be the full thing, kinda. Sounds a bit familiar...
