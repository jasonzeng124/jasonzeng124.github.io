Since the last blog post, was pretty busy (with hw) and didn't learn much.

wrt school, not much is happening... apush and lit are busy as usual, and chem test tmrw :pray:

ugh what did I do over the last two weeks :weary: I guess that is my answer....

at this point my plan is very simple - upsolve noi 24, virtual ioi, usaco upsolve

that's it, surely that's not a lot...

and idk, will try to read some physics

a lot to do and like no time to do it really sucks D: kinda wish i was a sophomore again

also a minor rant about school clubs - they are kinda a pain rn... in robotics our captain has like no idea what hes doing, he has been carried by the rest of the programming team the entire time and cant even code the most basic of stuff... and he wants me to do everything... well I don't have the time to do it, so too bad ig. cs club is dead, idk, I'm gonna have to try to revive it but do I really have a chance? theres like <5 oly kids total (1 freshman, 0 sophs, like me in junior year, that's it....) also once clubs actually start up, it's joever, I wont have any time at all :weary: how do people in like gunn high even run clubs...

well goodbye for now, I have to at least try to be productive, 3 lit assignments due friday (probably won't do them today)... hopefully i will be productive...
