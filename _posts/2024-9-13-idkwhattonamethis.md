uh ok so since last post (honestly not a long time) I didn't really do anything... Mostly just learned some special relativity (it's not as hard as it sounds, or at least until you read morin...).

Hard to be productive nowadays, I'm always so tired and not productive. Also, homework takes up too much time.

highlights of school:

- apush dbq on monday, probably going to study minimally and wing it
- lit is joever as usual, probably going to put minimum effort and take whatever grade I get (or drop or smth)
- not much interesting going on tbh

Tomorrow I want to do ABC + CF + UCup probably, then i'll skip virtuals this sunday for upsolve? I have 4 CNOI problems to upsolve, + a queue of random stuff, + usaco and stuff

actually, here is the queue:
- joi open remaining 2 problems
- sdoi ping guo shu
- uh where did my queue go???

ok so i will just read edi for all my cf tabs open lol (you can tell that I'm lazy)
