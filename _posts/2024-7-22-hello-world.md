Hello, some of my friends (notably _@iframe_) recommended that I start a blog, so here it is :P. Hopefully it is here to stay for $n \gg 1$ days...
You can expect posts on programming or other interesting problems, rants about life, maybe other things, idk.

The blog is 99% copied from [Hux Blog](huangxuan.me), many thanks to 黄玄 for building this.

Hopefully over the next few days, I'll add a few more posts.
