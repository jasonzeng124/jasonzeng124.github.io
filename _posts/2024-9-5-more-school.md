Just another week (well excluding tmrw) of school... wasn't rly productive at all, school (well a single class) is killing all my productivity.

(writing this rn cuz bored and dont want to do cp or hw D: )


for an overview of classes:

econ trivial ngl, easy teacher + doesn't give much work

gym... still have to fill out my opt out forms and get a study hall... maybe I'll audit some class during p2 study hall since I don't know any1 in p2 study hall lol

multi, should be trivial, surely... quiz tmrw so I'll see, hope I don't mess up description D:

apush, a lot of reading, dbq next week, surely it won't be that hard, kinda have to wing this class if I want to survive lol

lunch, when I don't have lab, is nice, I just play 拖拉机 with friends.

now the actually most doomed class ever: senior ap lit. yesterday one of the seniors came up to me and told me he already dropped, and that my teacher is the hardest in the school. and I'm the only one in the class that has to try cuz I'm a junior (and I'm in a senior class for \[idk\] reasons, even tho there exist junior senior lit classes)

it's actually joever

what's more painful for me is that he is a poetry main... and me, I'm really just a hardcore stem kid with no sense/appreciation/skill in poetry and really I'm bad at non stem stuff. its true

ok then i have physics, at least the teacher knows that I'm good at physics and asked me to advise him if theres anything he could do better or smth, i kinda forgot lol. 

after physics is chinese, trivial. funny story, this sophomore with chinese like 2000x better than me joined, then dropped the next day presumably cuz too ez lmao. well I'm taking this class cuz any other class I take is like less interesting, plus i kinda need free classes, im suffering enough already

then ap chem. test on monday on stoich, apparently over the years the average is 57% lmao how hard can stoich get... well ig i'll find out on tuesday, surely it's not *that* bad... like wtf can be so hard about it :skull:

ok wasted enough time writing this, bye for now ig, will update after i take like 2 tests and an essay probably.

oh btw fosters thm is so cool, too bad my physics progress is delayed again and again.
