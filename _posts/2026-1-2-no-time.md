Today I went over to visit relatives and played tractor all day.

Anyway today is the 2nd. School starts on the 5th. USACO is on the 10th. Not a lot of time, huh.

What I need to get done:

- read CSP/S 2025/4 edi
- do like 5 usaco problems (yessir $\ge 5$ i promise)
- do nonempty proper subset of hw
- finish stanford (idek if i'll apply caltech atp)
- review paper
- write enough robotics code to make stuff work

What I need to get done, longer term:

- actually continue thinking abt math
- continue grinding USACO
- robotics
- new year new gpa (read: my average grade should drop to like a 90 or lower)
- learn some physics
- teamscode
- maybe apply sparc and/or amp or somewhere
- probably some more stuff that I'm forgetting

wow thats a lot of stuff i gotta get done.
