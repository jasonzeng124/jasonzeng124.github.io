Before MIT decisions come out next Tuesday (:pray:), I want to jot down some of my general thoughts.

Applying to college as a camper has always felt somewhat strange. There are few schools (ok, just MIT, really) that actually recognize USACO camp, and really, at any other college except MIT, I feel somewhat like an ordinary applicant without a real edge. Plus, there is the very real possibility that schools will (yield) reject you for being a camper. Only campers can get crazy admissions verdicts such as "accepted into honors program, waitlisted from college".

So there's a significant bit of banking on MIT, already. And then, statistically, campers have pretty good chances of MIT, which is a good thing. And that's what I'm hoping for.

But what if I don't get into MIT? Then, I'm basically thrown in with the rest of the average CS applicants, and I have to shotgun. And still, I'll probably end up at like UT or UMD (basically the camper safeties at this point?) anyway, as I get rejected from everywhere better. There's not really an intermediate (quite literally i probably go to either MIT or UMD/UT/some similar state flagship); from what I've heard, a lot of campers get rejected from like the top 10 schools. And honestly, that's (I mean like going to UT/UMD/whatever) fine with me. Even going to Rutgers is fine with me. It just feels somewhat strange, though.

I feel like I've done a good amount of stuff in high school. Of course, I have some things that I wanted to do that I couldn't, and some things that perhaps I shouldn't have spent so much time on, but overall, I feel pretty good about this. Like the answer to "could/should/would I really have done more/less?" is almost certainly a no. Even the stuff that didn't work out (quite a lot of stuff actually) was valuable experience points that I probably wouldn't give up.

It's certainly a bit more than one should expect from a high school student, and perhaps it was better to relax a bit more and get a life or something. But most of it was fun, and I enjoyed it. I didn't do most of it for college apps, and looking back, those were the things I had the most fun with. They also (i think) have the most significance from a college-apps perspective. 

Going into high school, I definitely didn't expect to do this. Didn't expect to do any of this. In this respect, I'd consider myself pretty lucky.

And yet, looking at college apps, I've done so much... It'd be kinda depressing if I just didn't get in... It wouldn't exactly be true to say that I *should* get in, but that's what it feels like at times.

Well, even if I'm rejected literally everywhere, I have no regrets. no regrets at all. (well ig we'll see about that... or hopefully not...)

If I don't get in, I'll be pretty tilted. Of course, at the end of the day, it won't matter so much. But it'd be so annoying... And it'd feel, somewhat... unfair... not that I expect it to be fair, anyway.......

Well, let's just hope I get in...
