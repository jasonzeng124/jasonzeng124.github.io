So what happened today?

Shooter almost done. Should be shooting tomorrow. Yay ig. Too bad I won't be here tomorrow.

Drivetrain like... wired? not that it matters. Well it's "done" for some definition of done.... but who really cares?

CAD is theoretically making progress. In practice I have not seen it change for several days :skull:. Like we discussed some stuff like placing limit switches and cameras. but when do we see the indexer-shooter interface? when do we see spindexer with the motor mount?

???????

is there *any* progress??????

Ag you've got to be kidding me.

Also I work on drivetrain, there are annoying random code things to fix :skull:

-----

Mentor S proposed that he and I go in and do it ourselves. Probably a good idea.

Mentor D is proposing just building the WCP CC. Probably also a good idea.

LYT is telling me at unprecedented frequency to bail out. Probably also a good idea.

So anyway let's get to the fun part.

Mr. Hadzic came in. Anyway we eat dinner and then go try to fix the electrical issue. We fool around trying to get oscilloscope working (including stealing stuff from Teacher G). No use. Oh and one other thing. Why doesn't electrical have a working multimeter????????????????????????

Mr. H notices some crimps around the Rio that seem to be broken. Anyway it's those. Skull emoji.

After that. 1 hour of PID tuning. And then some shooter tests. It shoots 12 balls beautifully, around 20cm std I'd estimate.

And that's only one NEO vortex. Looks like LYT is wrong, we really didn't need 2 Krakns.

not looking very good ngl. but nothing I can do at this point. If the CAD isn't done on monday, though, I'm literally going to go in and start CADding myself. I can surely beat RS even though I have to learn everything first...
