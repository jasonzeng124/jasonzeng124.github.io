Today I went over to visit relatives and played tractor all day.

Anyway today is the 2nd. School starts on the 5th. USACO is on the 10th. Not a lot of time, huh.

What I need to get done (italics as of 1/25):

- read CSP/S 2025/4 edi (*tried, didn't understand*)
- do like 5 usaco problems (yessir $\ge 5$ i promise) (*oops*)
- do nonempty proper subset of hw (*done*)
- finish stanford (idek if i'll apply caltech atp) (*done*)
- review paper (*did not do*)
- write enough robotics code to make stuff work (*oops*)

What I need to get done, longer term:

- actually continue thinking abt math (*ahhhh*)
- continue grinding USACO (*uhh*)
- robotics (*blobsweat*)
- new year new gpa (read: my average grade should drop to like a 90 or lower) (*yay*)
- learn some physics (*uhh*)
- teamscode (*kinda doing*)
- maybe apply sparc and/or amp or somewhere (*did sparc*)
- probably some more stuff that I'm forgetting (*bruh*)

wow thats a lot of stuff i gotta get done.
