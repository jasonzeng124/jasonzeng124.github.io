Over the past month I've been writing a lot of blogs. The reason I've had so much to write about is because I've built a cache of ideas I want to rant about, as I ~~get tilted~~ go through life I add to this, I guess. Well now that I've roughly exhausted the cache (there are a few things I still want to write about, but that's about it), I probably won't have so frequent posts (especially interesting ones).

I've been intending to write more simple blogs about stuff like say, what I've done over the past week. Those tend to be more mundane however, although looking back on them is quite interesting.

During robotics season I plan on writing daily updates (when I'm there). Although there is good reason to expect that these will be mundane. Perhaps like a movie playing out (at least for me): I know what will happen but can't really change it. But if that's what robotics season looks like, I want to record that.

I promised that I would give some advice to some friends on how to blog. Honestly, it's worth writing down any interesting ideas so that you can blog about them later. And I will recommend some sort of general posting where you talk about stuff like what you did that week. It might seem unenlightening right now but looking back I think you would appreciate it.

As for publishing stuff, I've had mixed thoughts. It's nice to discuss stuff with friends and stuff, but at the same time I perhaps don't want just anyone reading these. For now, I'll continue publishing most of these, I guess.
