Written about the events of yesterday......

Was at robotics for like 5 mins yesterday. nothing notable.

Atharv promised me the cad would be done by EOD. But also whenever I turned to look at it he would spin it really fast "you can't see anything" Anyway I give him deadline of CAD done EOD shooter done tuesday.

Design call at like 9 pm yesterday too. Some routine matters. Nothing too major.

But found out plasma cutter is dead. Well I found out on Friday (when I ordered 10 flange bearings) but I assumed it was a skill issue, well it's a real issue :skull:. Looks like we aren't getting the flange bearings or the shooter done until the plasma cutter works. Theoretically we can get it working tuesday, but idk.

Well deadlines remain as usual, I guess, but pushed back again. I promise, I won't push these deadlines back again.

Shooter done EOD tuesday or we go to the backup plan.

Let's look at my day 2 timeline:

> - Rough hooded shooter prototype. 1/14. (done)
> - Rough two roller prototype. 1/14. (done)
> - Polished intake prototype. 1/15. (done)
> - Rough hopper & indexer prototype. 1/16. (uhhhh not really)
> - Polished shooter prototype. 1/20. (definitely not)
> - Rough interacting indexer & shooter prototype. 1/22. (no)

> - Initial intake cad. 1/14. (done)
> - Initial shooter cad. 1/16. (wip)
> - Rough cad of stuff put together. 1/21. (not really started)
> - Mostly final cad. 1/26. (no)

> - Start machining. 1/23. (no)
> - Robot done. 2/4.
> - Swerve and localization done. 1/23. (no... oops that's my fault)
> - Robot code done (ex. targetting). 1/27.
> - Shooter testing started. 1/29.
> - Programming done. 2/11.

well this is really behind. let me draw a picture of what needs to happen for the main design to work:

- shooter done 1/27
- indexer prototype with shooter 1/28
- robot cad 1/29
- start manufacturing 1/30
- robot done 2/9

on my side:

- swerve and localization done ASAP
- vision for ball tracking done 2/9
- shooting model done 2/16
- robot code done 2/20

and this is quite tight...

It's kinda funny that I told the team early in the season not to rely *too much* on the plasma cutter. Well i think they ignored me and went with the mentality of "plates are free we cut 17ft/s on the plasma cutter anyway". At least one instance of "manufacturing will be ez we have plasma cutter" did happen.

And actually for a while after I'd seen the speed myself I actually believed it. But of course things happen whenever it's the first time you do something.... and this is no exception.
