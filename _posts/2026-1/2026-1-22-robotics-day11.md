Today:

Did some more spindexer prototyping, well, works as expected. It is approved. Partly because it works, and partly because, well, do we really have a choice??? ????? ????? nothing else is like gonna be prototyped anyway??????? RS was in charge of spindexer CAD. As expected, it went nowhere.

I was gonna re-CAD the shooter to fix constraints but halfway in AG and I realized that the original was fine.

Shooter testing. Tried on brass flywheels, they work pretty well. Had some fun with taking a huge flywheel and spinning it to 6k RPM LOL (sorry mentors). Although fast consecutive shots are going to be hard to get without increasing inertia a bit, IMO.

RM is working on intake. Slowly.

We machined drivetrain box tubes. Some edges were a bit too long (sds swerve is kinda cursed) so it didn't fit. Mentors lowk crashed out over this, we figured out a solution or something idk. Afterward I realize "just file down corners". Well will be done tomorrow.

Shooter CAD: Same state as yesterday. Literally changed nothing.

Around tomorrow if nothing exceeds my (quite very low) expectations, then I might engage backup plan \dots....... well well well guess what i said earlier........ (ok tbh it's my fault, for getting powercrept sob)

*note: going to have to be a bit more concise, gotta sleep soon*
