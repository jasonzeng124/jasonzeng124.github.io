So USACO is this weekend. And F=ma is in 2 weeks.

Last time I checked they were both in forever.

-----

Three weeks just seems to fly by at lightspeed during build season. Maybe it's because I'm too busy doing stuff. But I just don't seem to notice time flying by.

It all feels like a blur.

-----

I'm not going to be very well prepared for f=ma or usaco. Not that I really intended to, I'm a senior after all.

But I did intend to do some preparation, and I've found that I've basically done none.

-----

No regrets, however. This is my last robotics season after all, and I want to do the best that I can. And it's fun.

I also feel kinda too tired to grind olympiads, and too old in a sense. Maybe burnout. Whatever I get, I get, I guess. If I make camp, that'd be nice. But if I didn't, well, at least I can let go of any such expectation right now (can i really?).

-----

What do I even do, after olympiads, and build season, etc? Supposedly being a senior means you have a lot of freedom and spare time, which I do have. I've been mostly filling it with robotics so far. But... what afterwards?

What do I even do?

I've been grinding for so so long...... Since around 8th grade... It feels somewhat weird to have time and not really a way to use it...

My former (middle-school?) self would find some project to work on, or something. But I think I need to recover from a good amount of accumulated burnout. But how?

I just know that playing tetris is probably not the way...
