Shooter is being assembled.

Tried to fix electrical issue. Likely conclusion is that it's the RIO, swapping it and will test tmrw.

Maybe our team can use reamers now??? I sure hope so (doubt).

HP is leading the drivetrain effort (slowly but steadily). yay.

intake+hopper prototype. works very well. intake soon to be approved and machined hopefully.

has design even moved an inch?

maybe something else happened. but I don't think so.

funny story:

anyway not only is KC PM dead, I'll just announce that my PM is dead too, functionally. it's not going anywhere.

So, instead of setting goals, let's paint a picture of what will actually happen, realistically, at this rate.

- first shooter, done and shooting 2/3
- robot cad, very slow progress. done perhaps like 2/6 ~ 2/10 maybe
- intake, started to machine around 2/5
- shooter, done 2/16 ish
- full robot, done 2/20 or later
- core robot code, done 2/26. this is just base, no shoot-on-the-fly, nothing too fancy
- simple autos, 3/3
- if we want better robot code (i.e. other stuff) it'll press right into competition. if that is the case I am not writing it.
- mechanical predicted slowdowns, average of ~5 days.
- no time for driver practice or driver tryouts

this is pressing very tight into our competition. And there's no buffer time here.

i reallllly don't like this.
