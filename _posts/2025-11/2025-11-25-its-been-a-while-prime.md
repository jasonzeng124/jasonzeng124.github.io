title, really. I plan on reviving this blog actually.

Looking back at my past blogs, it's kinda nice to know, like, kinda what i did... and looking back, I do regret not blogging at all.

I've been planning on writing a few blogs on more philosophical stuff too.

anyway, roughly, what did I do last year????? it feels......

well, I'm going to miss a lot of stuff here. sorry (to myself)... some stuff will also be a bit vague, sorry.

[some redactions have been applied to the below]

so through november, I was busy grinding the primes PSET (this will be a blog, hopefully?). I also took AMC.

after that, grinding RSI apps. and more summer camp apps. and more apps. ahhhh i hate apps (another blog probably)

during the break i travelled to california, that was nice, played some tractor.

all the while I didn't do much CP, didn't virtual anything, and trolled USACO december...

At this point my coursework has basically stabilized itself. A brief summary of some interesting classes:

there is no one in my period 2 study hall. maybe this is a good thing. I just solve primes problems on the whiteboard all day while some (former) sophomores stare at me like i'm crazy. At this point, maybe I was a bit crazy. 

APUSH work basically stabilized into reading and paying a bit of attention in class. I ended up taking like 70/80s on essays and getting 90+ on MCQ, haha.

AP literature turned out to be managable. I ended up having it easier than all of my friends, such is my luck, I guess. The grading turns out to be nicer than I imagined, which is nice. 

AP chem turned out to be fine. I occasionally had fun trolling the teacher (99 bottles of ch3ch2oh is peak).

Anyway, as I plunge into Janurary, nothing really eventful happens. Some grinding for physics / mechanics. Robotics build season (another blog post on this). Throwing usaco. More camp apps.

February. aime (10) (oh right my amc was like 109.5). f=ma(17). After f=ma i resolve myself to finishing a few more chapters of purcell, and then going through thermo.

Around this time I was rejected like literally everywhere lmao. like I went like 0/5 for summer camps, including reject at school stage for governor's school :noooo:.

Then, March; April. More grinding physics. Got through like chapter 8 ish. Took USNCO locals and qualified (46/60, cutoff was 45). planning teamscode. probably some more stuff, I really forget, my calendar isn't really accurate.

Apparently my calendar says hillshacks is around this time. like literally. 9. people were there. 7 were like executive board. At this point I don't belive in hillshacks again. I still don't. 

Oh and I threw all the USACO contests. no camp for me. Less net score than sophomore year too.

USAPhO. genuinely idfk how this happened, I was mocking like <1 problem consistently before the exam. Day of exam, I solve like 4-eps problems. Got gold, still pretty sure I missed camp from sillies, very sadge.

USNCO National exam. the most productive thing I did was eat cookies there. I got like <50% on multiple choice, literally drew hexagons on the free response, and like did the most stupid lab procedures possible. Titrating 10x diluted buffer with 1M HCl and wondering why the pH changes so fast. skull emoji.

May. AP exams. btw our robotics team failed, for like the third year in a row. Also, I forgot about the frisbee season, anyway we lost every game we played.

Anyway, the rest of the summer. I went on vacation for a week or two. teamscode. more grinding CMI. OPhO.

btw I kinda got into playing tetrio and nethack (for a while). i still play an unhealthy amount of tetrio.

To be honest, I have this sort of tingling regret about junior year... that there's something I wanted to still do, but I couldn't. In retrospect, I really couldn't have hoped for more, and yet... I really wanted to make camp...

and that's like until the start of this year? (ish). stay tuned ig?

lmk in comments if there is anything you want me to blog about, i guess.
