Today I decided to just stop waiting and build a shooter prototype myself.

In period 1 AP and I went down to rm 4 to start a shooter prototype. We did most of the drilling holes into wood but we put one of the holes too far and we didn't get any compression on the ball so it shot like one foot.

After school I immediately continue. We try using larger wheels for more compression but it still isn't fast enough.

Anyway I decide to actually make the prototype workable, adding bearings and a nice adjustable slot. I get mentor S to get some people to make flange bearings and then KL to cut all the wood for me. After some "go do this" and like a few hours, it's done. We test with drills (they aren't powerful enough).

Then Mr. Hadzic comes and we decide to slap a NEO Vortex (direct drive is so nice) on it. After like an hour or so we get everything working and it works pretty well. The consistency is pretty good and it looks very workable. Plus the compression and wheels all worked pretty well first try, we don't really have a lot of adjusting to do.

Well. Shooter prototype is finally done. It only took us a week. And it looks like we're not that far behind schedule.
