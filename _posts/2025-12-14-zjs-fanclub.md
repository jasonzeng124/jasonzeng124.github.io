TL;DR join the zjs fanclub discord [https://discord.gg/ur4WwfJspm](https://discord.gg/ur4WwfJspm) for updates on the blog.

I decided to make a more systematic way of publishing blog posts instead of copy-pasting to all my friends, so here it is. I was going to call it something else, but Zjs FanClub (ZFC) was a funny name to call it.

The server is really only intended for blog distribution but we'll see about that pretty soon.

Hopefully, this blog will last long enough for this server's existence to make sense.

That's it for now! I'll write some more soon, I promise.
