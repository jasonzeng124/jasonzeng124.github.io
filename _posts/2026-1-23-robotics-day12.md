We are at the point where if there is no significant progress made, we'll have to bail out for a (very simple) robot. I had half a mind to declare a bail already but I'll give AG one last chance. Well at least everyone knows about bailout plan :D.

The deadlines I set for AG are shooter CAD basically done today and shooter done tomorrow. Well AG wasn't really here today but I made enough progress on shooter CAD for it to count ig.

what happened today? i really don't remember. i'm so so so tired right now.

Intake cad is basically done, I guess? hasn't been reviewed yet.

RS is working on spindexer (i honestly have no idea how much progress has been made). it appears that he has been doing nonzero thinking however because we did have a discussion on how to do it best. MI drew some nice pictures which I agree with. In general, I think it'll work (maybe someone other than RS has to cad it though). But....:

RM AP me and co.. well ok, really just LYT. anyway on LYT's orders I got some kids to make a rough 118 belt prototype, it's WIP. I prefer this design if we can do it. It's just nicer in general.

A bit of shooter testing with a bit less compression, we've set a value for compression on the shooter. It's basically CADed, we just need AG review and to add mounting holes. Shooter should be basically CAD-ready for tomorrow cutting and manufacture.

Drivetrain is done. They did some trial-and-error freehand milling. And it is done. yay.

I want some prog members, who are competent enough to do stuff, to come in and do stuff. I'll have to enforce that a bit more, after all, one of these kids is gonna be captain. I need to offload some easy stuff and they need to learn it.

Also there are some kids sitting around doing nothing. It'd be nice to be a bit more efficient for these types of kids. Although to be honest we do need more skill than quantity right now.

Honestly most of today went along with no design members :facepalm: except me LYT and RS (so like 0.7 design members total). kinda tragic ngl.

Also like I told some electrical kid to find our cameras. and/or test out some random cameras they found. Well they failed. guess the world works like if I don't do it it doesn't get done :pensive:.


ugh im so so tired.
