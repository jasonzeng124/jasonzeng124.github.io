I think our robotics team might fail massively again, so, let's make some predictions to support that.

I expect around 70% of the predictions to turn out right, but we'll see.

In no order what-so-ever:

1. We don't make lehigh
2. AP / nobody becomes tech captain
3. We make a design with \ge 3 DOFs
4. I say something and nobody listens to me, but I'm right
5. < 10 hours of driving practice time
6. Driver tryouts never happens
7. Nontrivial robot mechanical changes in last week
8. Programming gets <2 weeks of time
9. Project management doesn't last past week 3
10. No dinner in week 4
11. I give up and decide grinding USACO is a better use of time
12. I don't approve the design
13. Drivetrain not done by end of week 2
14. No autos
15. We score 0 points in at least one match
16. We do worse than pingry
17. Design not finalized by week 1
18. Our robot tries to do >1 thing
19. Every single part in sight touches the CNC
20. We can't mount something
21. Something breaks really badly pre-comp
22. We stay after 10 PM
23. Literally nothing changes from last year
24. Someone says "no but we have the plasma cutter"
25. Failure is blamed on anything other than ourselves

To be honest, the only way that I can see that we suceed is if AG and I lock in and make everything work out somehow. I know for a fact that the mechies aren't changing a thing, anyway. Perhaps a good outcome would look like AG and I convince the team to build a simple shooter bot, and then when it comes out like 1.5 weeks before comp I have all the code ready and it works for the most part by 1 week.

Anyway, since there are 25 of them, here is your obligatory bingo (randomly generated):

| I don't approve the design | No dinner in week 4 | Someone says "no but we have the plasma cutter" | Every single part in sight touches the CNC | Something breaks really badly pre-comp |
| We do worse than pingry | Drivetrain not done by end of week 2 | We make a design with \ge 3 DOFs | We stay after 10 PM | I give up and decide grinding USACO is a better use of time |
| We can't mount something | Nontrivial robot mechanical changes in last week | We don't make lehigh | No autos | Programming gets <2 weeks of time |
| < 10 hours of driving practice time | Project management doesn't last past week 3 | Our robot tries to do >1 thing | Design not finalized by week 1 | Failure is blamed on anything other than ourselves |
| Driver tryouts never happens | We score 0 points in at least one match | I say something and nobody listens to me, but I'm right | AP / nobody becomes tech captain | Literally nothing changes from last year |

During the season I plan to have daily blog updates on what happens :D.
