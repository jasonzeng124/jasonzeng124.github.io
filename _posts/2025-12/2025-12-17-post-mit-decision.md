Well, turns out xdr was right, and I did have some thoughts.

The past few months were spent mostly, ish, grinding college applications. Now that I'm basically free of college applications, I have the freedom to do whatever I want. So what do I do?

Well, the past two days I've basically spent playing tetrio, perhaps that is not the ideal thing to do :skull:.

<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p>

I've always wanted to push for camp again. I think I'll pick up the cp grind again, over winter break, hopefully. I don't even know what will happen to USACO, but, whatever. I'll do the best I can, and whatever happens will happen, I guess.

I think that I'm a bit washed, though, based on trying a few problems. Hopefully, I can recover and improve pretty fast.

I'm also going to go for physics camp, albeit with much less effort. Although I'm still getting some imposter syndrome from somehow getting USAPhO gold while being, to be honest, not gold-level at physics.

And I'll probably take some time to continue blogging...

Oh and I want to push my sleep schedule back to like 10 PM, somehow. Given that it's already close to 10 as of writing, that seems very cooked. But sleeping past midnight consistently is taking a toll on me.

<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p>

In the true spirit of being a Rationalist TM, I tried predicting odds for a subset of my classmates. The results are not entirely out yet, but it looks like my predictions are going to be worse than just predicting coin flip for everyone.

I'll write a blog post on this later, but it's becoming more and more clear to me that college apps is just completely random. I thought I'd have some idea of how to predict college admissions, but after seeing the results, clearly I know much less than I thought I did. If you still don't believe it's random, try it for yourself! trust me, the more you learn about college apps the less faith in the system you will have.

An aside, I've considered sharing my application for transparency. Although I'm probably not going to share the full thing, perhaps I'll share some relevant portions later. At some point in the past I thought, maybe there should be more publically-available applications with results, so one can train one's binary classifier on it, but at this point I think that would be more noise than signal.

<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p>

Also, on the MIT discord, it looks like a lot of people recognize me, I don't even know how. perhaps I'm just too chronically online...

Anyway, for those of you waiting for cornell/penn/whatever, good luck! and if you were deferred MIT (rip), I wish you the best for RD (you'll get in trust)!


wow i should go sleep (definitely not sleeping before 10 today). bye!
