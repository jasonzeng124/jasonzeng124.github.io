So, I'll just jot down some interesting things that happened in the last 30 minutes of discussion (when I popped in).

There were a lot of orz TJ kids. I think they bussed in like a few teams all the way from VA to go here.

> AF introduced IZ as from his old high school :facepalm:

Question: What works to get people to join cp club?

> pizza (general agreement)

> nothing works when you're in high school -- me

AF mentions that in math, they have this thing where every Xday they go to some neighboring school on a bus, do some math like solving "what is 6*7", then eating dinner and pizza with friends. ... maybe could be applied to cp? could MITIT sponsor smth like this?

Better than doing usaco in your room by yourself, for 4 hours, solitary, well, you get it.

> lots of agreement, especially among TJ; would help if MIT sponsored b/c name brand

(actually a certain CET once asked me when i dropped scibowl for usaco twice this year, "do you really enjoy usaco over scibowl? It's so much fun..." sorry CET, I don't think you understand how I feel about USACO, and you might never understand this. but it's just something I can't give up, or won't, just yet......)

Codetiger encourages more in-persons and more contests like TJIOI and LIT etc. says that when he was at LIT he was always looking for contests on like hackathon.com or smth...

> general agreement

> online option is nice cuz yea

Holding contest is what brought MITIT together -> everyone had something to contribute instead of like grinding solo all day.?

Some fun fact: LIT asked like 300 sponsors in their first year. wow our CS club is lazy asf.

> it's not as hard as you think to organize an inperson...

Hmm, once IZ asked me if there was enough interest in in-person NACPC. I remember telling him that I was the only one from my school. It never happened, and tbh, I don't think it would have attracted enough people to be worth... unfortunate....

I personally agree but honestly like its not like I'll drive to TJ for a day for TJIOI, and i'm too lazy to do online ones sometimes. And like, our club, it's not going to budge even if I give them something to do (tried with IIMOC didn't work, rip).

> me: Something to keep in mind, TJ is not your normal high school. like... i'm from a relatively normal HS and we have like 5 people who have the skill to do any sort of cp... and like only 10 people who can solve a+b problem.

anyway at this point we basically end, i talk with a few tj kids about random stuff.

Well, these are all pretty good ideas. I won't implement them because they sound painful logistics-wise (quote IZ: and thus it won't be done). I don't think our school CS club will ever impl them too.

CP at our school will die with me. I'm certain about it. And, CS club will, more or less, revert to its original form of only hackathon, but with a much weaker organization.

Maybe it's a good thing that we run the hackathon, it doesn't look like anything else will work. and for the exact reasons. CP and like projects are really activities best done outside of clubs...

In any case, 3 years of trying has really convinced me, that this is not TJ, or Lex, and it isn't really possible to start some sort of cp club here. maybe it's skill issue, but then, oh well.

I do agree with most of these suggestions, and I really do hope that CP community will remain alive tho.

In his farewell speech alex mentioned usaco server. wow that brought back some memories. back then, usaco server was... idk how to describe it... ... ... ... quite alive. Back then the mods would create threads after every cf round and change the channel name manually. and in each thread there would be multiple people discussing... those were good times........ i'll probably write more about this later.

but then, I still find this in the greater CP community, and hopefully it'll stay there :D In general, in person CP contests are really nice, we should have more :pray: (more that are near me :pray:)


I might write a blog post on all of MITIT, soon TM.
