So results came out! We are worse walrus, div B.


Power round: 125 points, 17th div B, 40th overall.

Team round: 19th.

Overall team rank: 24th.

Pretty good. We did a lot better on team round than I thought, even with my throwing. Thanks to the team for carrying me!

Yet again (this applies the last time I went to pumac too), I can say that our best round was Power Round xD idk if this is a good thing XD (also I lost like 30 points on power round so this is probably sadge).

Individual (for me): I place 30th in combo, with `0011--0-`. tragic. The last one was fakesolve, the first 2 were silly. If i solved first 2 i'd be placed 6th..... big rip

Then number theory. `0000----`. absolutely tragic. that came as an absolute shock to me :sob:
wow. solved 4 and sillied all 4 is also crazy. that would've made indiv finals too :skull:

It looks like I'm quite washed.  Maybe it's a good thing that I retired from comp math after throwing AIME in sophomore year.

*edit: it looks like if i took alg or geo i'd have a chance at qualing too, if my quick looks are correct*

p.s. if anyone wants to invite me to another college math competition, please lmk, i'm down to go to most places on east coast
