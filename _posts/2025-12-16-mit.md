Ok, I got into mit!

Anyway, how it happened: on my way home from school, i check discord and see rfu sending me the portal astro. i open it and it's ac, i tell my mom. i go home and inadvertently fall asleep, my mom wakes me up at like 6:30 to check (i got in).

To everyone that said congratulations, sorry I didn't get to personally reply, i got like 300 notifications.

I'm most likely going to go to mit, but I'll probably apply to one or two more colleges. Well, at least I don't have to write essays over winter break.

LFL asked me if I had a reaction video. To be honest, i didn't, but its just like "i look at screen and say ok". maybe portal astro caused my reaction to be less pronounced, but idrc.

High school has been fun, and i'm nearing the end of it, finally. Thanks to everyone who believed in me! And good luck to everyone else in college apps!
