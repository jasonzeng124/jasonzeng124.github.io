Um really not that much happened today. Or, not that much that is noticable.

Events have more-or-less started to settle into a usual course of action...

Carpentry team is doing carpentry stuff. We've stolen the more useful members for prototyping.

We're building the drivetrain oversized with our punch tube (yay punch tube). There are some scuffed parts but I don't care, at least it's being done. Idea is to mount stuff to the oversized drivetrain to test.

We've tested some more intake configurations and we've settled on probably a one-roller intake with a ramp. I had RM design a basic, but fully functional intake to mount on our prototyping robot.

RS is gonna do another shooter prototype. AG is still designing full shooter, slowly (well there a lot of details that need figuring out).

Well now all prototypes are going on the plasma cutter, apparently. I sure hope it works...

That's about all that happened by the time I left?

------

It feels like I'm de facto captain, a bit. At least this means that people are doing the stuff I tell them to do... Or at least somewhat... But managing stuff is also a pain ngl.

I'm really micromanaging design team. The two sophomores that we have don't have that much sense (I don't really blame them). I basically had to tell RM what to draw, and honestly I don't know what happened to RS and the shooter prototype, AG is managing that (I don't understand what RS is talking about half of the time. A shooter prototype cannot be allat.)

I also have to like answer questions all over the place. That's nice in that I'm in control, but it's really unproductive to be running around making sure everything I need to be done is gonna get done, plus people trying to find me pretty often.

I'm also supposed to write swerve code but to be honest I haven't really been productive on that in between everything else. It'll get done tho.

Strategy is basically set at this point. A bit complex for my taste but I'll go with it. I have to, I guess.

If it comes to week 3 or 4 and we can't do it, I'm going to bail. I already have a backup design and LYT has a rough CAD for it too.

At least we are being somewhat productive, although not fast enough.

-----

Hopefully by Friday (we are not coming on Thursdays now), we will have some working prototypes. And hopefully we can keep up with schedule, although I already sense some falling behind.
