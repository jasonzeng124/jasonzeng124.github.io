This winter break, I was planning to do some CP (like 1 USACO/similar problem per day), and idk, do some exercise or something. Unfortunately due to (very valid) reasons I didn't really do anything. It does feel pretty bad to be wasting winter break away doing nothing all day......

It's somewhat unfortunate that I'm washed at CP b/c the few problems I've tried have been nontrivially hard for me, or at least not as easy as I would have liked. I'm currently struggling on CSP 2025 employ, fakesolved that RIP.

Looking back, I haven't really done any CP in 2025, smh, I should be doing more than this. I don't know how my camp chances are looking, but tbh I don't think I have that much of a chance, especially modulo senior / new changes / cheating.

USACO contest 1 is in <2 weeks, it might be over....... I really want to camp again, though. Aiming for like 1 solve (so 450-550 range? would be nice, but perhaps unlikely.)

Also, when I get back to school, I'll be on a backload of hw (like 3 hours at least :skull: am i even going to do it :skull:) :pensive: and also robotics stuff to do before kickoff :pensive: Looks like it'll be rough sob.

p.s. why haven't I even started on hw? ???
