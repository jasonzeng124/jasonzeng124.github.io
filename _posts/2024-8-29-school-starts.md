Ok so school started... didn't even finish homework, got thru 1 full + 2 half books. :skull: anyway a brief summary:

Econ was chill, did some random activity and have to do reading for hw, at least its brief lol. idrk anyone in the class except dx lol. hoping for easy class...

Didn't rly do anything in gym, talked with this guy who as 998244353 certifications and did some random cloud job at some company. He's so funny sometimes lmao. Probably going to opt out asap.

Multi was funny, the content should be mostly easy. I'm one of 2 juniors (cs is the other one) in that class, haha, not like the seniors are strong anyway i think... Ok well some of them are ok but the class should be a breeze for me hopefully :D

APUSH was ok, didnt rly do anything, dont rly know anyone in the class well except cs... hoping it won't be that bad, but dbq next week ahh.

Then played tuolaji during lunch, didn't win b/c of garbage cards lmao. literally had no zhupai so ...

Then afternoon... I'm the only junior in the senior lit class, hope they lock out to make it easier for me... otherwise it might kill my gpa, our teacher was ranting about how he hated nonfiction and liked literature and poems... and poem or smth essay next week

Physics was fine, I kinda doubt that the teacher is fast enough but idk, probably will end up grinding purcell or hrk in class or smth. again mostly seniors except dw.

Then I have chinese, free class :D

Then have ap chem.... my classmates descriptions didn't even get close to my teacher's insanity lol. this guy has like 4.8 average and has 3 chem campers wtf... and one of them was an alternate to IChO team actually wtf. I think this guy is serious.. he rated the class difficulty at 7 between regular chem and oly chem...... I might have to put some effort in ohno and i think half of my classmates are cooked.

ok that's it for now, since last post I didn't do any cp or physics, really.... hope I can catch up before dec... praying for easy classes...
