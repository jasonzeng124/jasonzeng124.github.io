Hi, I'm Jason Zeng (a.k.a. _@jay\_jayjay_ or _Alternet_ on discord). I'm a high school student who is interested in computer science, math, and physics. I mainly do competitive programming, and on the side I play CTF and try physics olympiad and math olympiads.

I started competitive programming a few years ago, and stuck to it because it was fun. I participate on codeforces, atcoder, and codechef sometimes (handle _jay\_jayjay_), and try to do other contests when I can. In the USA Computing Olympiad, I camped in 2024. Competitive programming is fun, I highly recommend it :).

I also play CTF on the side on team CPCSEC as a pwn main. (Our team usually almost AK's crypto and misc, and usually gets no pwn solves, so I can hardly claim to be a pwn main, I guess...)

I also sometimes prepare for math or physics olympiad. If you go to college math contests on the East Coast, you might see me :D.
